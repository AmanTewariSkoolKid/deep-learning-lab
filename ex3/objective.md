Experiment 2: Building Neural Networks from Scratch
a.	Implement a single neuron with weighted inputs for the AND gate and verify its functionality
b.	Extend to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) for XOR/AND operation using multiple layers and neurons
c.	Implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture for solving more complex functions/datasets
